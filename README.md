# DPS Filters project repo
This project is heavily based on the work of github user gavv. 
His github repo is [here](https://github.com/gavv/snippets/tree/master/decode_play)
see details in his [blog post](https://gavv.github.io/blog/decode-play/).

# Overview

This project implements a digital filter in the time domain in c++.
This is accomplished by implementing the difference equation directly.
For examples of this look at the AllpassFilter.{cpp,h} and FIRFilter.{cpp,h} files.
an output variable (y) is generated by using the input and delayed versions of an
intermediate variable. (This is a direct form 2 implementation, direct form 1 can
be used but it requires a second delay buffer.)

The project is split into three parts an audio decoding program (in ffmpeg_decode.cpp),
a playback program (ffmpeg_play.cpp), and the actual filter (FilterProject.{cpp,h}).

The decoding program outputs the raw samples from the audio file over stdout the filter program
takes the samples and filters them (well, duh) then again outputs them over stdout. Last, the 
playback program takes the samples and does magic on them so the linux audio system can play
it back.

One gotcha is that since the files are typically stereo left and right samples are interleaved.
this means that each buffer should be twice as long as designed, then every other index is used.
For example to implement a 2nd order filter a buffer with a length of 6 is needed then indexes
0, 2,and 4 will be used.

**The filter should be implemented in the do_filtering() function.**

Decoded samples are always in the same format:
* linear PCM;
* two channels (front Left, front Right);
* interleaved format (L R L R ...);
* samples are 16-bits sighed integers in little endian (actually CPU should be little-endian too);
* sample rate is 44100 Hz.

Note that the raspberry pi works much better if the GUI has been turned off (just google it).
# Compiling the code 

A note on format any font that looks
```
like this (aka has three tick marks before and after it)
```
is meant to be typed into a terminal (command line) on the pi. Remember that pressing tab a few times auto-completes.

To get the project working start with a raspberry pi with a bootable sd card. 
The pi should be running, logged in, with a keyboard and screen plugged connected, **and connected to the internet**.

Steps to filtering goodness
1. Change the keyboard layout (it defaults to a UK layout)
  Run the following command in the terminal to change the layout.
  ```
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration 
  ```

2. Reboot the pi (this makes the changes take effect)
  ``` 
  sudo reboot 
  ```

3. Get my code from git
  ``` 
  git clone https://github.com/sellicott/DSP-FFMpeg-Reverb.git 
  ```

4. Install the required packages (this is the audio decoding library)
  ``` 
  sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavdevice-dev 
  ```
  This installs the three listed packages from the raspbian software library.

5. Next move into the directory and compile the code 
  ```
  cd DSP-FFMpeg-Reverb
  make
  ```
  This will (hopefully) build all of the code needed to run your project.

6. Now you need some great music 
  Put your files on a flash drive, the connect the drive to the pi. Next copy the files
  into the directory with the code. Your flash drive will be in the /media/pi/name_of_your_drive.
  Assuming that your file is on the root directory of your flash drive:
  ``` 
  cp /media/pi/name_of_drive your_snazzy_audio_file.mp3 ./ 
  ```

7. Now you can run your filter
  The decoder, filter, and playback programs must be connected via pipe.
  (A pipe takes the output from stdout from one program and "pipes" it into
  the input for another program.) To use your filter run the following command.
  ``` 
  ./ffmpeg_decode your_snazzy_audio_file.mp3 | ./ffmpeg_filter | ./ffmpeg_play 
  ```
  Note that the input audio file can be in almost any format.

# Implementing Filters
In the FilterProject.cpp file the function do_filtering implements the filters for the project.
(The main file calls another function get_samples() which calls )
